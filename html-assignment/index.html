        <p>
            I am <em>Yee Ting Lau</em>, a media design learner. I grew up in Hong Kong and now staying in Ottawa for my
            study. Tracy is my nickname, which is common to use in <abbr title="Hong Kong">HK</abbr>. Proudly raised in
            <abbr title="Hong Kong">HK</abbr>, the place combining western and Chinese cultures broadens my horizon and
            teaches me critical thinking.

            I have two main hoobies:

            </dl>
        </div>
        <div>
            I also have several interests:
            <ul>
                <li>Reading novels</li>
                <li>Listening Canton Pop</li>
                <li>Walking in the streets and parks</li>                
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>    
        I have a favourite motivational quote:
            <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/5647">
                <q>And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.</q>
                <cite>- Paulo Coelho. The Alchemist</cite>
            </blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>
            People will be capable to do something in different stages. Once I desire, as long as I have the ability, I
            believe that I will success with the others' help. If we don’t know whether we have the ability, try is
            always the best way to test.
